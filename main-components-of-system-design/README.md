# Main components of System Design

The main components in system design are:

1. User Interface: This component is responsible for allowing users to interact with the system. It includes the layout, design, and controls of the interface.
2. Input/Output: This component handles the data that is input and output by the system. It includes the devices used for input (e.g. keyboard, mouse) and output (e.g. screen, speakers).
3. Processing: This component is responsible for performing the necessary calculations and operations on the input data. It includes the central processing unit (CPU) and memory.
4. Data storage: This component is responsible for storing and retrieving data. It includes storage devices such as hard drives and databases.
5. Network: This component is responsible for connecting the system to other systems and devices. It includes wired and wireless connections, and protocols used for communication.
6. Security: This component is responsible for protecting the system and its data from unauthorised access and malicious attacks. It includes firewalls, encryption, and authentication methods.
7. Scalability: This component is responsible for the ability of the system to handle increasing loads and traffic. It includes the ability to add more resources such as memory, storage, and processing power.
8. Performance: This component is responsible for ensuring that the system runs efficiently and quickly. It includes the optimisation of the system's components and the use of performance monitoring tools.
9. Recovery: This component is responsible for ensuring that the system can recover from failures or errors. It includes backup and restore procedures, disaster recovery plans, and failover mechanisms.
10. Maintenance: This component is responsible for keeping the system running smoothly and efficiently over time. It includes monitoring, troubleshooting, and updating the system's software and hardware.
11. Compliance: This component is responsible for ensuring that the system meets legal and regulatory requirements. It includes compliance with data privacy laws, industry standards, and security best practices.
12. Monitoring: This component is responsible for keeping track of the system's health, performance and overall usage. It includes tools and processes for collecting and analysing system metrics, as well as alerting and reporting mechanisms.
